Thinkful Data Science Bootcamp

## Overview
Thinkful Data Science FLEX program is a year long online Data Science Bootcamp. This program includes six months of technical training and six months of career advising. During the technical training, I meet one-to-one with an industry mentor twice a week. 

This repository encapsulates the majority of the assignments and capstones I've completed over the course of the program. Each directory relates to a specific concept or topic I learned about. The data files used within the jupyter notebooks is not accesible through this repository. Directions and links to the location of the data files are documented within the directory's respective README.md files.
