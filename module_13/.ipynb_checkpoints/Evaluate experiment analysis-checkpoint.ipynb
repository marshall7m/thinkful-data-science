    "The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used."

Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future."

The Windu listeners may of not wanted to take survey after. Especially if they were busy preparing for a war or somekind of other endeavor.
