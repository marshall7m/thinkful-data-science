Both were only ridden a couple times, and are in truly excellent condition. \nI can meet you in Town, North Shore or other parts of the island.\n\nGamma: 6'0\" X 19 1/8\" x 2 1/2\" 29.7 L / Futures  /Helium / $450\nGamma: https://firewiresurfboards.com/products/gamma \n\nAl Merrick Neck Beard 2: 5'8\" x 19 3/8\" x 2 7/16\" 29.7 L / Futures  / PU / $480\nhttps://www.cisurfboards.com/board/neckbeard-2/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hfMIeq9z-w  (Dane rides Neck Beard 2 at 8:19 of Electric Acid Surfboard Test)\n\nGamma:\nThe Gamma is Kelly\u2019s ultimate utility shortboard built in our popular HELIUM technology.\n\nKelly has worked with many great shapers throughout his life, refining an array of different shapes, and it\u2019s all been distilled into the Gamma: a shortboard designed for rapid speed and quick direction changes in varying conditions.\n\nThis shape came from Kelly\u2019s enthusiasm for CAD design, modifying variables, and testing, retesting, testing again, and then landing on his favorite all around shape. But Kelly is quick to mention that this was more than just him in the lab alone, \u201cThanks to all my friends who have been riding them and giving feedback,\u201d he says. \u201cThis one has definitely been a group effort.\u201d\n\nWhen you view the Gamma\u2019s outline for the first time, a hip is immediately noticeable. This enables a tight turning radius, allowing Kelly (and everyone else) to surf this shape two different ways: short and wide, or long and narrow.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve given everyone the choice between High Performance dimensions and Groveler dimensions.\n\nThis board has a single concave through nearly the entire hull, with a slight vee happening behind the thruster box. So, the Gamma will excel most for surfers who favor big, forceful movements on rail, and maneuvers commonly associated with power surfing.\n\nNeck Beard 2 (Channel Islands / Al Merrick) :  \nWhen something isn\u2019t broke, there\u2019s no need to fix it. That said, Britt Merrick and Dane Reynolds still felt a few slight refinements would make an already epic board that much better. And it did: The merits to this update can be seen in Dane\u2019s new surf film \u201cThe Electric Acid Surfboard Test.\u201d\n\nA big fan of single concave, Dane asked Britt to take out the vee from the original Neck Beard, creating single throughout. This changed the rocker landscape some, but in a very positive way\u2014enhancing its wave entry, down-the-line speed, and overall control. They also widened the tail block 1/2\u201d and added a slight hip, resulting in increased responsiveness and maneuverability.\n\nDane prefers the Neck Beard 2 as a tri-fin, but those that like quads may notice added down-the-line speed. It comes with a five-fin setup to get the best of both worlds.  Available in both PU/PE and EPS Spine-Tek.

Enjoyed the quad mobility. Great for the North shore of course, but it has also been ridden at Cloudbreak in Fiji. It has some repaired dings but is watertight. It is now history, and has been hanging unridden for years. I realize that I will never surf it again so I am letting go.\nWhy quads? For larger waves, speed and controlled turns, set your rails with 2 fins in the water. Jeff Clark of Mavericks said: \"Tri-fins pivot. Quads have inherent speed and hold . . . First instinct on late drops is to set a rail; tri-fins want to straighten out. It's that centering thing -- trying to set a rail and battling with the back fin. Quads want to find one rail. Unlike a three-fin board, there is no conflict between front and rear fins. They are all pointed towards the nose on either side of the board.\" And that is where my experimenting began - but I was younger then.  \n\nGoogle: Danny Nichols, Lightning Bolt Maui, the history and evolution of quads.\n\nTo see this board and others that I am selling go to Used Surfboards Hawaii on Queen street or check out the board online on their website.\n    ", "condition": ["good"], "manufacturer": ["Lightning Bolt Maui"], "model_name": ["Danny Nichols Gun"], "size_dimensions": ["7'5\" x 19\""]},

One of the key notable changes was the addition of displacement hull designed by both Hayden Cox and well-known Australian Naval Architect, Andy Dovell. The second key feature being the snowboard inspired side cuts.\n\nSimilar to that of a boat design, the hull softens the water flow through the entry of the board. It hits the ridge of the hull, and is dispersed into the single concave. When taking off late, this assists in planing through choppy water or helping to land critical maneuvers.\n\nThe side cuts shorten the radius of turns, meaning the board will draw a much tighter arc. During bottom turns, it engages the 3 dimensional curve that the side cut creates, which draws the surfer up the wave face. This then transitions onto the inside rail which pulls the surfer around and back into the pocket with ease.\n\nFor a shorter and wider board that\u2019s strikes the balance between performance and innovation, the Psychedelic Germ has all the features needed to bring a whole new dimension to surfing.

The more pointy nose and mellow rocker makes it feel a little more aggressive on the face of the wave which I like a lot. I've surfed it in decent swell at Ho'okipa or tiny slop at 1000 Peaks.
